# Introduction

In 2013, researchers at Google DeepMind published the paper Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning, in which for the first time, a neural network algorithm learned how to play a video game in a fairly organic sort of way by playing against itself and training on the images produced from those play sessions. Since then, in just five short years, a whole host of enthusiastic data scientists have trained neural networks on a wide variety of different games. Most of these games have been Atari games, but for our project we wanted to be a bit more ambitious and try ***Super Mario Bros.*** for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), using Deep Q-Learning. In particular, this means we want to get Mario to the end of the level before time runs out and without dying.
